# University-Project
This is my university semester project. In this project I did all Server side work using J2ee and Oracle sql.
For frontend my group member used HTML5 CSS3 and Pure Javascript.
To run this code successfully first of all you will have to deploy this project to server such as Apache Tomcate 10 or GlassFish server
and than create Oracle file with user name "OFO" and password "ofo".
There are some tables in sql database which you will come to know when you through this project.
Thanks!
